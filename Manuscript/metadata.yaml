abstract: "The effects of periodic forcing of a nonlinear limit-cycle oscillator
          at varying relaxation rates allow for the theoretical study of periodic
          pulsatile stimulations of cardiac oscillators. Here, we successfully replicate
          a mathematical model by Glass & Sun (1994) analyzing the dynamics of this system.
          We remark on the differing phase-locking regions given varying relaxation rates,
          stimulus intensities, and time intervals between stimulations; as well as algebraically computed the boundary along the 1:0 and 1:1 phase locking regions and identified a tangent bifurcation."
